# Client-Server-Development

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

To write good software, you should adhere to writing code into small, independent functions or classes which allows for easier updates. Variables and functions should be descriptive, e.g., fetch_user_by_id() instead of getData(). You should also be allowing configuration via function arguments instead of hardcoding values. Using a modular CRUD system provides the advantage of reusability where the same functions were used in different widgets without duplicating database logic. Also the security is enforced by centralizing database access which helps enforce security measures like SQL injection prevention and access control. Any future applications requiring a database can reuse this module. It can be used in data pipelines for logging, analytics, or reporting.


How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist, I approach problems using a structured and logical methodology. For the Grazioso Salvare project, I first analyzed the requirements, designed a normalized database schema with optimized queries, and implemented a modular CRUD Python module for database interactions. The dashboard was built to dynamically fetch and visualize data efficiently, ensuring usability and performance. Compared to previous assignments, this project was more client-focused, required greater modularity, and emphasized real-time data interaction and security. Moving forward, I would incorporate ORMs, database replication, and caching for scalability, while also prioritizing client-centric development with API integrations and data analytics. This structured approach ensures that future projects remain efficient, secure, and adaptable to changing business needs.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists design, develop, and optimize software and systems to solve complex problems, improve efficiency, and drive innovation. Their work is essential in various industries, from business automation to artificial intelligence. In projects like Grazioso Salvareâ€™s database and dashboard system, computer scientists create scalable, secure, and efficient solutions that enhance decision-making and operational workflows. By streamlining data management and visualization, my work would help Grazioso Salvare quickly access critical information, optimize resource allocation, and improve overall efficiency, ultimately allowing them to better fulfill their mission.
